# Figures for Understanding Linear Algebra

Here is the source code for the figures that appear in the open-source
linear algebra text *Understanding Linear Algebra*.  It relies on Bill
Casselman's [Piscript
package](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/piscript/), which runs only
under Python2.  Be sure to read the section **Problems** on the
installation page and follow the instructions.
